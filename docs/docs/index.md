## Highly Efficient Imaging Genetics (HEIG)

**HEIG** is a statistical framework written in Python for efficient joint analysis of imaging and genetic data, focusing on voxel-level analysis. 

The analyses can be performed by **HEIG**:

- Voxel-level genome-wide association analysis
- Voxel-level heritability and genetic correlations in images
- Cross-trait genetic correlations between voxels and non-imaging phenotypes
- Generating and sharing a minimal dataset of summary statistics for secondary analyses at voxel level
